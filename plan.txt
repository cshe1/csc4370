Problem:

- User/Client (Cory) has a choose-your-own adventure story that needs to be interactive. The interface for the story should be engaging and simple to use.
- We, the Designers/Developers (Cory, Shannon, Kathleen), will use HTML and CSS to meet these goals.

Design: 

- We will create a mockup of the general layout for the story pages.
- We will use HTML to build pages with the existing story text.
- We will use CSS to style the text, introduce animations, create background imagery for the story, and maintain a consistent style between pages. 

Testing:

- We will traverse the story from page to page and ensure that all links, animations, etc. work as expected.
- We will use the W3C validation services to make sure all HTML and CSS files are W3C compliant.
